This is my toolbox for Natural Language processing. I will keep adding and sharing scripts as I write them.
Most of my descriptions are ment to work with Danish, nordic dialects and Old Norse. Comments in the code are also written in Danish.
However, each script will come with documentation in both Danish and English.

tegnliste.py - This script give you an overview of what characters you have in your text.

tegnfjerner.py - By using the list generated by tegnliste.py, it will remove the characters from your target text.

udtr√¶kker.py - The purpose of this script is to extract certain grammatical endings and sound patterns in a word list.

sort.py - This script takes each word, remove all duplicates, and lists every word in alphabetic order in a separated text file.
